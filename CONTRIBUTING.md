# Development pattern for contributors

1.  [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main SpacePY-X repository](https://github.com/alshapton/SpacePY-X) on GitHub.

2.  Make your changes in a branch named something different from `master`, e.g. create a new branch `my-pull-request`, where 'my-pull-request' is <issue number>-<short description> e.g. #98-add-crew-dets

3.  Please follow the [Python style guide for PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible - PEP-8 styling is still to be applied across some areas of the code.

4.  Add new tests if necessary.

5.  Run the existing and any new tests (test.zsh is a runner script that will do this)

6.  SpacePY-X uses [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to create a common format for commits. Follow the instructions in the "Making your repo Commitizen-friendly" section of the guide [here](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cl/)

7.  [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
