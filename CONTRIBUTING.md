# Development pattern for contributors

1.  [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main SpacePY-X repository](https://github.com/alshapton/SpacePY-X) on GitHub.

2.  Make your changes in a branch named something different from `master`, e.g. create a new branch `my-pull-request`, where 'my-pull-request' is <issue number>-<short description> e.g. #98-add-crew-dets
   
3.  [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

4.  Please follow the [Python style guide for PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible - PEP-8 styling is still to be applied across some areas of the code.

5.  Add new tests if necessary.

6.  Run the existing and any new tests (test.zsh is a runner script that will do this)
